# Project Overview
This project is a 3D rhythm game built using the Godot 4 game engine. It draws inspiration from Guitar Hero. Players hit moving notes in time with the music to score points.

The game is a work in progress. The goal is to eventually publish it on platforms like Steam and Itch.io.

# Godot uuid
Godot gd script files have unique identifiers that are referenced in tscn files. Whenever editing a tscn file, make sure the CORRECT uuid is used. The uuid files are GENERATED BY GODOT itself. Do NOT create your own uuid files.

# MCP Server Usage Guidelines
There are several MCP servers available for use to help code this project. You can make use of these to help with different aspects of the project:
- Context7 - a documentation-focused MCP server that can be used to get information about Godot Engine features and APIs. Use this when researching how to implement specific functionality or when you need detailed explanations of Godot concepts.
- Godot - a Godot-specific MCP server to do tasks like starting the Godot editor, running the project, and getting project information. Use this to interact with the Godot Engine environment.

# Testing
Testing of the gd scripts is done with GdUnit4. Tests are located in the /test folder.
