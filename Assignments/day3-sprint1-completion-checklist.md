### Use of AI Agents

**Questions to Consider**:
- Has the student actively used AI agents throughout Sprint 1? Provide examples or evidence.
- Does the work show sophisticated multi-agent coordination patterns from Assignment 4?
- Are multiple AI agents being coordinated effectively for different development tasks?
- Is there evidence of MCP integration and context preservation between agents?

**Evidence Observed**:


### AI Interaction Logs and Documentation

**Questions to Consider**:
- Has the student properly documented their multi-agent coordination in a log file?
- Are the coordination logs clear, complete, and demonstrate sophisticated AI workflow?
- Is there clear evidence of agent role definition and handoff protocols?
- Does the documentation explain technical decisions made with AI assistance?

**Evidence Observed**:


### Technical Implementation

**Questions to Consider**:
- Is there a working project foundation with core functionality demonstrable?
- Does the project show professional code organization and structure?
- Is there meaningful commit history with professional Git workflow?
- Does the code quality meet professional standards with appropriate commenting?
- Has a basic testing framework been set up with initial test cases?
- **Consider the Sprint 1 checklist criteria**: Does the work meet the standards outlined in the Technical Implementation Requirements? Reference specific criteria when providing feedback.

**Evidence Observed**:


### Professional Documentation

**Questions to Consider**:
- Is there comprehensive project documentation (README, architecture overview, setup instructions)?
- Are setup instructions clear enough to enable project reproduction?
- Does the documentation meet professional standards suitable for portfolio presentation?
- Is there evidence of decision logging and challenge resolution documentation?

**Evidence Observed**:


### Suggestions for Improvement
- Provide specific recommendations for Sprint 2 development
- Identify areas where multi-agent coordination could be enhanced
- Suggest documentation or technical improvements


### Overall Assessment
- [ ] **Below Satisfactory** - Sprint 1 foundation incomplete, lacks required multi-agent coordination evidence, or documentation significantly below professional standards
- [ ] **Satisfactory** - Sprint 1 foundation complete and working, demonstrates effective multi-agent coordination, meets professional documentation standards
- [ ] **Above Satisfactory** - Sprint 1 exceeds requirements with sophisticated technical implementation, innovative multi-agent coordination, and exemplary professional documentation
