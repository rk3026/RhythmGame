## Sprint 1 Completion Checklist

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Core Architecture** (Must Complete All):
- [x] **Project Repository**: Professional GitHub repository with clear organization (Scripts/, Scenes/, Assets/, Documentation/ structure)
- [x] **Development Environment**: Fully configured and documented setup process (Godot 4.x project with proper imports and autoloads)
- [x] **Basic Functionality**: Core project foundation working and demonstrable (full gameplay pipeline: chart parsing → spawning → input → scoring → results)
- [x] **Code Structure**: Professional organization with clear module boundaries (separate scripts for parsing, spawning, input, scoring, rendering, UI management)
- [x] **Version Control**: Meaningful commit history with professional Git workflow (descriptive commits tracking feature implementation)

**Multi-Agent Coordination** (Must Demonstrate All):
- [x] **Agent Role Definition**: Clear roles assigned to different AI assistants (Logic/Coordinator/Ideas/Visuals agents defined in ProjectOverview.md)
- [x] **MCP Integration**: Assignment 4 patterns applied to project development (context handoff pattern used for multi-agent workflows)
- [x] **Coordination Log**: Documented evidence of sophisticated AI workflow (`.github/copilot-logs.md` with 14+ entries showing prompts and responses)
- [x] **Context Preservation**: Effective handoff between agents for complex tasks (Coordinator delegates to specialized agents with context packages)
- [x] **Error Handling**: AI-assisted troubleshooting and problem resolution (documented chord detection and timing accuracy challenge resolutions)

**Professional Standards** (Must Meet All):
- [x] **Code Quality**: Industry standards with proper commenting and structure (snake_case naming, design patterns implemented, inline documentation)
- [x] **Documentation**: README, setup instructions, architecture overview (README.md with installation steps, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with architecture rules)
- [ ] **Testing Setup**: Basic testing framework with initial test cases (planned for Sprint 4)
- [x] **Error Handling**: Edge cases considered and basic error handling implemented (missing audio handling, empty sections filtering, variable lane count support)
- [x] **Performance**: Basic performance considerations addressed (object pooling in progress, frame-based input to avoid per-note polling, spawn scheduling to avoid runtime iteration)

### Documentation Requirements

**Project Documentation** (Must Include All):
- [x] **README.md**: Project overview, setup instructions, usage examples (main README.md with feature list and getting started section)
- [x] **Architecture Documentation**: Technical design decisions and rationale (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` with comprehensive architecture rules and patterns, `Documentation/Core Infrastructure.md` with .chart specification)
- [x] **AI Coordination Log**: Multi-agent workflow documentation with examples (`.github/copilot-logs.md` with full prompts and responses showing context handoffs)
- [x] **Setup Instructions**: Clear environment configuration and dependency management (Installation section in README with Godot setup and custom song instructions)
- [x] **Code Comments**: Professional inline documentation explaining complex logic (inline comments in ChartParser, note_spawner, input_handler explaining algorithms)

**Process Documentation** (Must Maintain):
- [x] **Git Commit Messages**: Clear, professional, and meaningful (descriptive commits like "Implement chord-aware input detection with timing windows")
- [x] **Progress Tracking**: Sprint 1 milestone completion tracking (Sprint 1 section in ProjectOverview.md with completed/in-progress/challenges breakdown)
- [x] **Decision Log**: Major technical decisions with AI agent input documented (AI coordination notes in Sprint 1 section, challenges/solutions documented)
- [x] **Challenge Resolution**: Problem-solving approaches and solutions recorded (3 major challenges documented in Sprint 1: chord detection, timing accuracy, variable lane count)

## Sprint 1 Peer Review Assessment

### Peer Review Information
- **Reviewer Name:**
- **Reviewee Name:**
- **Date:**
- **Project Title:**

### Use of AI Agents

**Questions to Consider**:
- Has the student actively used AI agents throughout Sprint 1? Provide examples or evidence.
- Does the work show sophisticated multi-agent coordination patterns from Assignment 4?
- Are multiple AI agents being coordinated effectively for different development tasks?
- Is there evidence of MCP integration and context preservation between agents?

**Evidence Observed**:


### AI Interaction Logs and Documentation

**Questions to Consider**:
- Has the student properly documented their multi-agent coordination in a log file?
- Are the coordination logs clear, complete, and demonstrate sophisticated AI workflow?
- Is there clear evidence of agent role definition and handoff protocols?
- Does the documentation explain technical decisions made with AI assistance?

**Evidence Observed**:


### Technical Implementation

**Questions to Consider**:
- Is there a working project foundation with core functionality demonstrable?
- Does the project show professional code organization and structure?
- Is there meaningful commit history with professional Git workflow?
- Does the code quality meet professional standards with appropriate commenting?
- Has a basic testing framework been set up with initial test cases?
- **Consider the Sprint 1 checklist criteria**: Does the work meet the standards outlined in the Technical Implementation Requirements? Reference specific criteria when providing feedback.

**Evidence Observed**:


### Professional Documentation

**Questions to Consider**:
- Is there comprehensive project documentation (README, architecture overview, setup instructions)?
- Are setup instructions clear enough to enable project reproduction?
- Does the documentation meet professional standards suitable for portfolio presentation?
- Is there evidence of decision logging and challenge resolution documentation?

**Evidence Observed**:


### Suggestions for Improvement
- Provide specific recommendations for Sprint 2 development
- Identify areas where multi-agent coordination could be enhanced
- Suggest documentation or technical improvements


### Overall Assessment
- [ ] **Below Satisfactory** - Sprint 1 foundation incomplete, lacks required multi-agent coordination evidence, or documentation significantly below professional standards
- [ ] **Satisfactory** - Sprint 1 foundation complete and working, demonstrates effective multi-agent coordination, meets professional documentation standards
- [ ] **Above Satisfactory** - Sprint 1 exceeds requirements with sophisticated technical implementation, innovative multi-agent coordination, and exemplary professional documentation
