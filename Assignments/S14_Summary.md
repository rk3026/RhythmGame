Added better visuals to gameplay (lane flashes, particle effects)
Refactor the chart editor - still work in progress
- moving notes with playback
- note placement preview
Settings scene UI rehaul
Add other volume settings to settings scene - music, sfx, ui
Refactor the MIDI parsing system and audio playback (when song is split into different audio for each instrument)
Add new gameplay mechanic - limit break - add to UI and new keybind (space).

What to do for next sprint:
- Finish the chart editor - get to the point where player can save their edited chart and then play it.
- Possible to hook the game up to Steam for leaderboard, multiplayer, etc. but this is a stretch goal, and pretty complex, not likely to finish.
