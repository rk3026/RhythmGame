## Session Structure Overview

**INSTRUCTOR NOTE**: You will be present for first and last 10 minutes only. The middle 30 minutes is unsupervised structured activity.

### Part 1: Instructor Present - Setup & Expectations (10 minutes)

#### Opening and Context Setting (3 minutes)
**Today's Mission**:
- Create detailed Sprint 1 plan for Week 9 implementation
- Document plan in your project README
- Collaborate with peers to validate scope and approach
- Prepare for Monday peer review (plan + any weekend progress)

**Monday Deliverable** (due before class Oct 13):
- Project repository with Sprint 1 plan documented in README
- Initial setup/progress (commits, code structure, AI logs)
- Evidence of AI coordination workflow active

#### Sprint 1 Planning Framework (7 minutes)

**What to Plan for Sprint 1 (Week 9 Implementation)**:

**Core Focus**: Project foundation and architecture
- Set up working development environment
- Implement basic project structure with professional organization
- Create core architecture with key components identified
- Establish AI coordination workflow with documented logs
- Begin initial feature implementation

**Realistic Scope Guidance**:
- Sprint 1 is about **foundation**, not finished features
- Plan for architecture + 1-2 core features at basic level
- Leave room for learning curve and unexpected challenges
- Document what you'll deliver for Monday Oct 13 peer review

**Documentation Requirements** (for your README):
```markdown
## Sprint 1 Plan (Week 9)

### Goals
- [Core objective 1]
- [Core objective 2]
- [Core objective 3]

### Specific Deliverables
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2
- [ ] Deliverable 3

### Technical Approach
- Brief description of architecture/approach

### AI Coordination Strategy
- Which agents for what tasks
- How you'll document interactions
```

#### Questions and Clarifications (0 minutes)
**Open floor for questions** before unsupervised work begins.

### Part 2: UNSUPERVISED WORK - Sprint 1 Detailed Planning (30 minutes)

**INSTRUCTOR ABSENT - Students work independently/collaboratively**

#### Individual Planning Work (15 minutes)

**Primary Activity**: Document Sprint 1 plan in project README

**Tasks to Complete**:
1. **Review HW5 proposal** and Monday's peer feedback
2. **Define Sprint 1 scope** using framework from opening
3. **Write Sprint 1 section** in your project README
4. **List specific technical tasks** needed for Sprint 1
5. **Identify AI agents** you'll use and for what purposes
6. **Plan your week** - what you'll work on when

**Self-Assessment Questions**:
- Is this achievable in one week of part-time work?
- Do I have the technical knowledge needed, or do I need to learn something first?
- What could go wrong, and what's my backup plan?
- Does this align with what will be peer-reviewed Monday?

**Use AI Agents**:
- Ask ChatGPT/Claude/Copilot to help break down your project into tasks
- Get suggestions for realistic scope
- Document these interactions in your AI coordination log

#### Peer Collaboration Time (15 minutes)

**Track-Based Groups** (optional but encouraged):
Form small groups by track (Game/Web/Mobile/Data Science) for:

**Peer Scope Validation**:
- Share your Sprint 1 plan with 1-2 peers
- Get feedback: Is it realistic? Too ambitious? Too conservative?
- Discuss technical approaches and architecture decisions
- Share AI coordination strategies that worked well

**Peer Discussion Prompts**:
- "Here's what I'm planning for Sprint 1. Is this realistic?"
- "I'm unsure about [technical decision]. What do you think?"
- "How are you planning to use AI agents in your workflow?"
- "What are you most worried about for Sprint 1?"

**Document Helpful Feedback**: Note any insights that change your plan.

### Part 3: Instructor Returns - Wrap-up & Monday Preparation (10 minutes)

#### Quick Status Check (3 minutes)

**Round-Robin Sharing** (1 minute each for volunteers):
- "What's your Sprint 1 focus?"
- "Any concerns or blockers identified?"
- "What helpful feedback did you get from peers?"

#### Action Items Before Monday (4 minutes)

**Between Now and Monday Oct 13**:

**Required**:
- [ ] Finalize Sprint 1 plan in your project README
- [ ] Push updated README to GitHub repository
- [ ] Begin implementation work (even if just setup)
- [ ] Make some commits showing progress
- [ ] Start AI coordination log with at least 2-3 entries
- [ ] Prepare for peer review on Monday

**Monday Peer Review Will Assess**:
- Sprint 1 plan quality and realism (in README)
- Evidence of progress (commits, code, AI logs)
- Active use of AI agents (documented in logs)
- Overall: Below Satisfactory / Satisfactory / Above Satisfactory

**Submission**:
- **Due**: Monday Oct 13 before class (4:00 PM)
- **Where**: GitHub repository (share link on Canvas)
- **What**: Updated project with Sprint 1 plan + initial progress

#### Weekend Work Recommendation (2 minutes)

**Suggested Weekend Activities** (optional but beneficial):
- Complete any remaining environment setup
- Start implementing first Sprint 1 task
- Experiment with AI agents on real project work
- Document what works well in your AI coordination approach
- If stuck, use AI agents to troubleshoot or ask questions on discussion board

#### Final Encouragement (1 minute)
- "You now have a clear Sprint 1 plan"
- "Your peers validated your approachâ€”trust it"
- "Remember: Sprint 1 is about foundation, not perfection"
- "Active AI coordination will accelerate your development"
- "See you Monday for peer reviews!"
