## Troubleshooting

### Scores Are Leaking Between Profiles

**Check in Godot debugger:**
Press F6 to open debugger, go to "Debugger" tab ‚Üí "Monitors" ‚Üí Add these watches:

```gdscript
ProfileManager.current_profile_id
ScoreHistoryManager.current_profile_id
ScoreHistoryManager.history_path
```

**Expected values:**
- Both profile IDs should match
- history_path should be: `user://profiles/[unique_id]/scores.cfg`
- Each profile should have DIFFERENT unique_id

**If they're the same, check:**
- Line 186 in ProfileManager.gd has: `ScoreHistoryManager.set_profile(profile_id)`

---

### Achievements Are Leaking

**Check console output:**
Look for these messages when loading profiles:
```
ProfileManager: Loaded profile: Alice ([profile_id])
AchievementManager: Loaded achievement progress for profile [profile_id]
```

**Each profile should show different [profile_id]**

**If missing, check:**
- Line 189 in ProfileManager.gd has: `AchievementManager.load_profile_achievements(profile_id)`

---

### Switch Profile Button Missing

**Check:**
1. Main menu left sidebar
2. Between "SETTINGS" and "QUIT"
3. Button text: "SWITCH PROFILE"

**If missing:**
- Open `Scenes/main_menu.tscn` in Godot editor
- Check scene tree for "SwitchProfileButton" node
- Verify button is not hidden

---

### Crashes on Profile Load

**Check console for errors:**
- "Invalid access" errors ‚Üí Script issue
- "File not found" errors ‚Üí Profile directory issue

**Verify file structure:**
Open file explorer to `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\[project_name]\profiles\`

Should see:
```
profiles/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profiles_list.cfg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [profile_a_id]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile.cfg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scores.cfg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ achievements.cfg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [profile_b_id]/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile.cfg
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scores.cfg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ achievements.cfg
```

---

## Debug Commands

If you need to debug, open the Godot script console and run:

### Check Current Profile
```gdscript
print("Current profile: ", ProfileManager.current_profile_id)
print("Current username: ", ProfileManager.current_profile.username)
```

### Check Score System
```gdscript
print("Score profile: ", ScoreHistoryManager.current_profile_id)
print("Score path: ", ScoreHistoryManager.history_path)
print("File exists: ", FileAccess.file_exists(ScoreHistoryManager.history_path))
```

### List All Profiles
```gdscript
for p in ProfileManager.get_all_profiles():
    print("Profile: ", p.username, " | ID: ", p.profile_id)
```

### Check Achievement Count
```gdscript
var unlocked = 0
for ach in AchievementManager.achievement_progress.values():
    if ach.unlocked:
        unlocked += 1
print("Unlocked achievements: ", unlocked)
```
