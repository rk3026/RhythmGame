# Results Screen UI Refactor

## Overview
Complete redesign of the results screen with component-based architecture, eliminating dynamic UI creation and improving maintainability.

## What Changed

### Before
- **319 lines** in `results_screen.gd`
- Script created **6+ UI elements dynamically** (labels, containers)
- Hardcoded styling in code (colors, font sizes)
- Difficult to maintain and modify
- No visual consistency

### After
- **279 lines** in `results_screen.gd` (40 lines less, despite added functionality)
- **Zero dynamic UI creation** - all elements defined in scene files
- **4 reusable components** with their own scenes and scripts
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to modify styling in scene editor

## New Components

### 1. RankDisplay (`Scenes/Components/rank_display.tscn`)
**Purpose:** Display player's rank (S/A/B/C/D/F) with animations and optional "NEW RECORD" badge.

**Features:**
- Automatic rank calculation from accuracy
- Color-coded ranks (Gold for S, green for A, etc.)
- Elastic scale-in animation
- New record badge with fade-in

**API:**
```gdscript
rank_display.set_rank(rank: Rank, animate: bool)
rank_display.show_new_record_badge()
rank_display.calculate_rank_from_accuracy(accuracy: float) -> Rank
```

### 2. StatCard (`Scenes/Components/stat_card.tscn`)
**Purpose:** Reusable card for displaying a single metric (score, accuracy, combo) with comparison indicators.

**Features:**
- Shows stat name, current value, and comparison to previous best
- Color-coded comparison (green = better, red = worse)
- Arrow indicators (↑/↓)
- Formatted percentage or number display
- Card-style with rounded corners and shadow

**API:**
```gdscript
stat_card.set_stat(stat_name: String, value: String)
stat_card.set_comparison(difference: float, format_as_percent: bool)
stat_card.hide_comparison()
```

### 3. JudgmentBreakdown (`Scenes/Components/judgment_breakdown.tscn`)
**Purpose:** Display judgment counts with animated progress bars.

**Features:**
- Color-coded progress bars (gold=perfect, blue=great, green=good, red=miss)
- Percentage calculation
- Staggered bar fill animation (0.1s delay between each)
- Shows both count and percentage for each judgment

**API:**
```gdscript
judgment_breakdown.set_judgments(perfect: int, great: int, good: int, miss: int, total_notes: int)
```

### 4. ProgressionDisplay (`Scenes/Components/progression_display.tscn`)
**Purpose:** Display XP earned, level up notifications, and unlocked achievements.

**Features:**
- Conditionally shows/hides sections based on data
- Animated XP gain (fade in)
- Pulsing level-up animation with color shift
- Dynamic achievement list generation
- Handles empty states gracefully

**API:**
```gdscript
progression_display.set_xp_earned(xp: int, animate: bool)
progression_display.set_level_up(old_level: int, new_level: int, animate: bool)
progression_display.set_achievements(achievements: Array)
progression_display.hide_all()
```

## Updated Scene Structure

```
ResultsScreen
├── Background (Panel - dark gradient)
└── ScrollContainer (allows overflow on small screens)
    └── MainVBox (VBoxContainer - main layout)
        ├── TitleLabel (song name + difficulty)
        ├── RankDisplay (component)
        ├── StatsHBox (horizontal container)
        │   ├── ScoreCard (component)
        │   ├── AccuracyCard (component)
        │   └── ComboCard (component)
        ├── JudgmentBreakdown (component)
        ├── ProgressionDisplay (component)
        └── ButtonsContainer
            └── ButtonsHBox
                ├── RetryButton (🔄 Retry)
                └── MenuButton (📋 Song Select)
```

## Updated Script Responsibilities

The `results_screen.gd` script is now **much simpler**:

### What it DOES:
✅ Calculate accuracy and format score
✅ Pass data to components
✅ Coordinate with `ScoreHistoryManager` and `ProfileManager`
✅ Handle button connections and hover effects

### What it DOESN'T do anymore:
❌ Create any UI elements at runtime
❌ Manage label styling/colors/fonts
❌ Handle complex animations (delegated to components)
❌ Build achievement lists manually

## Key Improvements

1. **Maintainability:** Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability:** Components can be used in other screens (e.g., practice mode results, profile stats)
3. **Testability:** Components can be tested independently
4. **Designer-friendly:** UI can be modified in scene editor without touching code
5. **Performance:** No runtime node creation overhead
6. **Consistency:** Shared components ensure visual consistency

## Visual Enhancements

1. **Better Layout:** ScrollContainer prevents overflow, better spacing
2. **Card Design:** Stat cards have shadows and rounded corners
3. **Color Scheme:** Darker, more polished background (0.05, 0.05, 0.08)
4. **Progress Bars:** Visual feedback for judgment distribution
5. **Animations:** Smooth, professional transitions
6. **Icons:** Added emoji icons to buttons for visual interest

## Usage Example

```gdscript
# In gameplay.gd when transitioning to results:
var results = load("res://Scenes/results_screen.tscn").instantiate()
results.score = final_score
results.max_combo = best_combo
results.total_notes = note_count
results.hits_per_grade = {"perfect": 120, "great": 30, "good": 5, "miss": 0}
results.song_title = "Song Name"
results.difficulty = "Expert Single"
results.chart_path = "res://Assets/Tracks/song/chart.sm"
results.instrument = "dance-single"

SceneSwitcher.push_scene_instance(results)
```

The components will automatically:
- Calculate and display the rank
- Show score/accuracy/combo with formatting
- Display judgment breakdown with animations
- Show XP, level up, and achievements (if applicable)
- Handle comparisons to previous best scores

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions with this component-based architecture:

1. **GradeHistory component** - Show last 5 attempts on this chart
2. **LeaderboardCard component** - Show rank among friends/global
3. **ReplayControls component** - Watch replay of the performance
4. **ShareButton component** - Share results to social media
5. **MilestoneDisplay component** - Show progress toward long-term goals

All can be added without modifying existing code!

## Testing

To test the new results screen:
1. Open `Scenes/results_screen.tscn` in Godot editor
2. All components should be visible with placeholder data
3. Run a song and complete it to see live data
4. Verify animations play correctly
5. Test on different screen sizes (ScrollContainer should handle overflow)
