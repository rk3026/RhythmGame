# Profile Deletion UX Improvements

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Version:** 0.5.1  
**Status:** Implemented ✅

---

## Problem Statement

### Original Issues:
1. **Confusing Error:** Users could click "Delete" on their active profile and receive error: `"Cannot delete active profile. Switch to another profile first."`
2. **No Visual Indicator:** Users couldn't tell which profile was currently active
3. **Context Confusion:** profile_select.gd is used in TWO contexts:
   - **Initial Launch:** No profile active yet
   - **Profile Switch:** Profile IS active (from main menu)
4. **Poor UX:** Delete button shown on ALL profiles including active one

### User Complaints:
> "When users try to delete their own profile, it gives an error saying they can't delete the active profile. But then it doesn't make sense to give the option to delete. There needs to be some clear guidelines on active profile and the UI."

---

## Solution: Context-Aware Profile Selection

### Design Philosophy:
- **Make active profile obvious** with visual indicators
- **Hide unavailable actions** (don't show delete button on active profile)
- **Provide clear context** in all messages
- **Respect user intent** (switching vs first-time selection)

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Active Profile Detection

**In `profile_select.gd._ready()`:**
```gdscript
# Track if we're switching profiles (vs initial selection)
var is_switching_profiles: bool = false
var active_profile_id: String = ""

func _ready():
    # Check if we're coming from main menu (switching) or initial launch
    is_switching_profiles = not ProfileManager.current_profile_id.is_empty()
    active_profile_id = ProfileManager.current_profile_id
    # ...
```

**Purpose:**
- Detects whether user is coming from main menu (profile active) or game launch (no profile)
- Stores active profile ID for comparison

---

### 2. Context-Aware Profile Cards

**In `_create_profile_card()`:**
```gdscript
func _create_profile_card(profile_data: Dictionary):
    var card = ProfileCard.new()
    var profile_id = profile_data.profile_id
    var is_active = profile_id == active_profile_id
    
    if is_active:
        # Active profile: can't delete, show indicator
        card.show_delete_button = false
        card.show_export_button = true
        card.show_active_indicator = true
    else:
        # Inactive profiles: can delete and export
        card.show_delete_button = true
        card.show_export_button = true
        card.show_active_indicator = false
    
    # Only connect delete signal for non-active profiles
    if not is_active:
        card.delete_requested.connect(_on_profile_delete_requested)
```

**Purpose:**
- Active profile: NO delete button (can't delete what you're using)
- Active profile: Shows "● ACTIVE" badge
- Inactive profiles: Full delete/export functionality

---

### 3. Visual Active Profile Indicator

**New Property in `ProfileCard.gd`:**
```gdscript
@export var show_active_indicator: bool = false
var active_badge: Label  # "ACTIVE" indicator
```

**Active Badge Display:**
```gdscript
# Username row with optional active badge
var username_hbox = HBoxContainer.new()

username_label = Label.new()
username_label.text = username
username_hbox.add_child(username_label)

# Active badge (only shown if show_active_indicator is true)
if show_active_indicator:
    active_badge = Label.new()
    active_badge.text = "● ACTIVE"
    active_badge.add_theme_font_size_override("font_size", 16)
    active_badge.add_theme_color_override("font_color", Color(0.4, 1.0, 0.4))  # Bright green
    username_hbox.add_child(active_badge)
```

**Visual Result:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Avatar]  ExileLord  ● ACTIVE       │  ← Green badge
│           Level 42                  │
│           ████████░░ 80%            │
│                                     │
│ Last played: 2 hours ago            │
│                                     │
│ [Export]          (no delete btn)   │  ← Delete hidden
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
     ^ Green border                       ^ Active profile
```

---

### 4. Enhanced Border Styling

**In `ProfileCard._create_panel_style()`:**
```gdscript
func _create_panel_style() -> StyleBoxFlat:
    var style = StyleBoxFlat.new()
    
    if show_active_indicator:
        # Active profile gets special highlighting
        style.bg_color = Color(0.18, 0.22, 0.18, 0.95)  # Slight green tint
        style.border_width_left = 3
        style.border_width_top = 3
        style.border_width_right = 3
        style.border_width_bottom = 3
        style.border_color = Color(0.4, 1.0, 0.4, 0.8)  # Green border
    else:
        # Normal profile card styling
        style.bg_color = Color(0.15, 0.15, 0.2, 0.95)
        style.border_width_left = 2
        style.border_width_top = 2
        style.border_width_right = 2
        style.border_width_bottom = 2
        style.border_color = Color(0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 1.0)
    # ...
```

**Visual Differences:**
- **Active Profile:**
  - Green border (3px thick)
  - Slight green background tint
  - Brighter appearance
- **Inactive Profiles:**
  - Gray border (2px)
  - Standard dark background

---

### 5. Improved Delete Confirmation Dialog

**Enhanced Message:**
```gdscript
func _on_profile_delete_requested(profile_id: String):
    # Get profile info for better messaging
    var username = _get_profile_username(profile_id)
    
    delete_confirm_dialog.dialog_text = 
        "Are you sure you want to delete the profile '" + username + "'?\n\n" +
        "All associated data will be permanently lost:\n" +
        "• Scores and rankings\n" +
        "• Achievements and progress\n" +
        "• Settings and keybindings\n\n" +
        "This action cannot be undone!"
```

**Before:**
```
Are you sure you want to delete this profile?
This action cannot be undone!
```

**After:**
```
Are you sure you want to delete the profile 'PlayerName'?

All associated data will be permanently lost:
• Scores and rankings
• Achievements and progress
• Settings and keybindings

This action cannot be undone!
```

**Purpose:** Clear communication of consequences

## User Flows

### Scenario 1: Initial Game Launch (No Active Profile)

**Flow:**
1. Start game → Profile Select screen
2. All profiles shown with:
   - ✅ Delete button (can delete any)
   - ✅ Export button
   - ❌ No "ACTIVE" badges (no profile loaded yet)
   - Standard gray borders
3. User selects profile → Loads into main menu

**Result:** Users can manage all profiles freely

---

### Scenario 2: Profile Switch from Main Menu (Profile Active)

**Flow:**
1. Main Menu (Profile A active) → Click "SWITCH PROFILE"
2. Profile Select screen shows:
   - **Profile A:**
     - "● ACTIVE" badge (bright green)
     - Green border (3px)
     - Export button ✅
     - NO delete button ❌
   - **Other Profiles:**
     - Standard gray appearance
     - Delete button ✅
     - Export button ✅
3. User can:
   - Switch to another profile (click any card)
   - Delete OTHER profiles (not active one)
   - Export any profile

**Result:** Clear visual distinction, no confusing errors

---

### Scenario 3: Attempting to Delete Active Profile (OLD BEHAVIOR)

**Old Flow:**
1. Click delete on active profile
2. Error: `"Cannot delete active profile. Switch to another profile first."`
3. User confused: "Why show delete button if I can't use it?"

**New Flow:**
1. Active profile has NO delete button
2. User cannot attempt to delete (button doesn't exist)
3. No error, no confusion

**Result:** Prevention > Error handling

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Single Profile Scenario
**Problem:** What if user only has 1 profile and it's active?

**Solution:**
- Active profile: No delete button
- Can create new profile
- Can import profile
- Can export active profile (for backup)
- Cannot delete last/active profile

**User Action:** Must create/import another profile first, switch to it, THEN delete old profile

---

### Case 2: Switching to Same Profile
**Problem:** User on Profile A, goes to profile select, clicks Profile A again

**Solution:**
- ProfileManager detects same profile, logs warning but continues
- No data loss or corruption
- Seamless re-selection

---

### Case 3: Profile Deleted While Viewing
**Problem:** What if profile is deleted programmatically while viewing?

**Solution:**
- ProfileManager.delete_profile() checks `current_profile_id`
- Returns `false` if attempting to delete active profile
- Signal `profile_deleted` only emitted on success
- UI only updates on successful deletion

---
