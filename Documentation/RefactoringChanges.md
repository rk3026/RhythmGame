# Profile System UI Refactoring - Single Responsibility Principle

## Overview
Refactored the profile selection and profile view screens to follow single responsibility principle. Scenes now handle visual layout while scripts handle only logic and data binding.

## Changes Summary

### Profile Select Screen

#### profile_select.tscn
**Added:**
- Complete UI hierarchy defined in scene file
- Added `CenterContainer` to properly center the profile grid
- Added `unique_name_in_owner` flags to key nodes:
  - `ProfileGrid` - GridContainer for profile cards
  - `CreateProfileButton` - Button to create new profile
  - `QuitButton` - Button to quit application
- Pre-existing dialog structure maintained with proper node paths

**Changed:**
- Reorganized node hierarchy for better structure
- Changed `ErrorLabel` name in dialog from `UsernameError` to `ErrorLabel` for consistency

#### profile_select.gd
**Removed:**
- `_build_ui()` method (90+ lines of UI creation code)
- `_show_create_profile_dialog()` method (80+ lines of dialog creation)
- `_close_create_dialog()` method
- `_add_button_hover_effect()` method
- All programmatic UI element creation
- Old variable declarations for UI elements

**Added:**
- `@onready` variables to reference scene nodes using `%` unique names
- Direct node path references for dialog elements
- `_on_quit_pressed()` handler for quit button
- `_delete_profile()` helper method

**Changed:**
- `_ready()` now only connects signals and loads data
- `_on_create_profile_pressed()` now only clears inputs and shows existing dialog
- `_on_profile_delete_requested()` uses scene's `delete_confirm_dialog` instead of creating new one
- All references from `profiles_container` to `profile_grid`
- Dialog show/hide using `.popup_centered()` and `.hide()` instead of `.popup()` and `.queue_free()`

**Result:**
- Script reduced from ~330 lines to ~200 lines
- Only handles logic: loading profiles, validation, signals, data management
- No UI creation or layout code

### Profile View Screen

#### profile_view.tscn
**Added:**
- Complete UI hierarchy with proper structure:
  - Navigation bar with Back and Edit buttons
  - Header section with avatar panel, name, bio, and level indicator container
  - Stats section with header and stats grid container
  - Achievements section with header, progress label, and achievements grid
  - Proper dividers between sections
- Added `unique_name_in_owner` flags to key nodes:
  - `BackButton`, `EditButton` - Navigation buttons
  - `ProfileAvatar` - TextureRect for avatar display
  - `ProfileName`, `ProfileBio` - Labels for profile info
  - `LevelIndicatorContainer` - Container for dynamic level indicator
  - `StatsContainer` - GridContainer for stats (3 columns)
  - `AchievementsGrid` - GridContainer for achievements (2 columns)
  - `AchievementProgress` - Label for achievement completion percentage
- Pre-configured theme overrides (font sizes, colors, separations)

**Changed:**
- Background ColorRect now has proper full-screen anchoring
- All layout containers properly configured with size flags and separations
- Stats grid pre-configured with 3 columns
- Achievements grid pre-configured with 2 columns

#### profile_view.gd
**Removed:**
- `_build_ui()` method (80+ lines)
- `_build_header_section()` method (60+ lines)
- `_build_stats_section()` method (20+ lines)
- `_build_achievements_section()` method (40+ lines)
- All programmatic UI element creation (200+ lines total)
- Old variable declarations for section containers

**Added:**
- `@onready` variables for all UI elements using `%` unique names
- Variable for `achievement_progress_label`
- Level indicator now created in `_ready()` and added to `level_indicator_container`

**Changed:**
- `_ready()` now connects button signals, creates level indicator, connects manager signals, and loads data
- `_update_achievements()` directly updates `achievement_progress_label` instead of searching for it
- Script now purely data-focused: loads, formats, and updates data in existing UI elements

**Result:**
- Script reduced from ~365 lines to ~150 lines
- Only handles logic: data loading, formatting, updating, signal handling
- No UI creation or layout code

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- UI changes can be made in Godot editor without touching code
- Visual tweaks (colors, spacing, sizes) done in scene file
- Scripts are easier to read and understand (less cluttered)
- Separation of concerns makes debugging easier

### Performance
- UI elements created once at scene load, not at runtime
- No dynamic UI generation overhead
- Faster scene initialization

### Designer-Friendly
- UI can be edited visually in Godot editor
- No need to modify code for layout changes
- Theme overrides can be adjusted in editor
- Preview changes without running the game

### Code Quality
- Scripts follow single responsibility principle
- Reduced code duplication
- Clearer data flow
- Easier unit testing (logic separate from UI)

## Testing Checklist

### Profile Select Screen
- [ ] Profiles load and display correctly
- [ ] Create profile button opens dialog
- [ ] Profile creation validation works
- [ ] Profile cards are clickable and load profiles
- [ ] Delete button shows confirmation dialog
- [ ] Profile deletion works
- [ ] Quit button exits application
- [ ] "No profiles" message shows when empty
- [ ] Navigation to main menu works after profile selection

### Profile View Screen
- [ ] Avatar displays correctly
- [ ] Profile name and bio show properly
- [ ] Level indicator displays with correct data
- [ ] All 12 stats display in 3-column grid
- [ ] Playtime formats correctly (hours/minutes)
- [ ] Average accuracy formats as percentage
- [ ] Achievements load and display in 2-column grid
- [ ] Achievement completion percentage updates
- [ ] Back button returns to previous screen
- [ ] Edit button (placeholder) handles click
- [ ] Live updates work (stats, level-ups, achievements)

## Migration Notes

### For Future Development
- When adding new UI elements, add them to the `.tscn` file
- Use `unique_name_in_owner = true` for elements that need script access
- Reference them in script with `@onready var element_name: Type = %ElementName`
- Keep scripts focused on data and logic only

### Breaking Changes
None - the refactoring maintains all existing functionality while improving code organization.

## Files Modified
1. `Scenes/profile_select.tscn` - Complete UI structure defined
2. `Scripts/profile_select.gd` - Reduced to logic only (~40% size reduction)
3. `Scenes/profile_view.tscn` - Complete UI structure defined
4. `Scripts/profile_view.gd` - Reduced to logic only (~60% size reduction)

## Verification
All files compile without errors. No warnings. Ready for testing.
